                            <p>In the development of Finulab, the main objective was to create a platform which
                                welcomes
                                market participants to exercise their right to the freedom of speech by expressing
                                different perspectives, as well as their countering criticisms. Generally, we cannot
                                and
                                must not take information at face value on the basis of trust. This is especially
                                the
                                case in our financial markets; given that, if the information is discovered to be
                                incorrect, not only do we have to overcome the embarrassment of having abided by it,
                                but
                                also, in some cases, financial loss. Rather than accepting information on the basis
                                of
                                trust; it is imperative to subject that information to a critical review process.
                                Through that process, fair criticisms can arise which can then mold the given
                                information into either the accepted truth or debunked, fake narrative. We believe
                                that
                                these discussions are not only informative and supportive in the performance of due
                                diligence, but also a means of identifying the truth in perhaps the most chaotic
                                sphere
                                of life: business. </p>

                    <p>As a financial terminal, Finulab’s objective is to ensure every glance offers insights which
                        support investors’ journey towards financial freedom. To these ends, Finulab also provides easy
                        means of engaging with financial data through providing recommendations (buy, hold, or sell) and
                        price targets. We firmly believe in the motto: “united we succeed”. Even though an individual
                        recommendation or price target may be wrong, the collective recommendations and price targets of
                        the market offers actionable insights. We believe market participant’s engagement on Finulab
                        through citizen journalism and market analysis is a tremendous public service; as such, we
                        believe that a nod of appreciation is not a sufficient means of demonstrating our gratitude for
                        Finulab’s users. Mere words of thanks, although kind, cannot tangibly benefit users’ lives.
                        Hence, we have augmented Finulab with a reward protocol through Finux. </p>

                        WebSocket services to provide real-time sentiment data for both stocks and cryptocurrencies.
                        Finulab will ensure that there is a free-tier access to the data for low volume API requests.
                        However, high volume requests, which place great loads on our systems, will require payment
                        through Finux. Finux will be the only acceptable currency to obtain any and all market sentiment

                            consideration of market participants’ needs. As such, this white paper’s status is and will
                            continue to always be: “work in progress”. As we continue to expand our suite of
                            applications, products, and services, the utilities offered by the Finux token will only
                            continue to grow. Hence, in accordance with our growth, this white paper will be updated to
                            appropriately to reflect our cutting-edge developments and the additional utilities of
                            Finux. </p>

                                section 3. As a result, we view Finulab as a platform which open sources financial news
                                and analysis from market participants; further, we understand that the value of Finulab
                                as a financial research platform is contingent on users’ contributions. Hence, to
                                incentive quality contributions and encourage citizen journalism, Finulab is committing
                                100% of Finux’s supply to rewarding the users of the platform. As a byproduct of these
                                rewards, users obtain the following privileges. </p>

                        American corporations. Notice that even for these companies, the count of polled analysts does
                        not seem statistically significant. Further, despite having access to the same information,
                        these analysts reach vastly different recommendations and price targets, which reduces the
                        system’s reliability. Hence, in the development of Finulab our main focus was on improving this

                        general public. To do so, we must first answer the following question: we will then utilize our

                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">In order to address the question in the previous section, we must first define
                        market price, and
                        determine how its numeric value is reached. NASDAQ’s glossary defines “market prices” as, “the
                        amount of money that a willing buyer pays to acquire something from a willing seller, when a
                        buyer and seller are independent and when such an exchange is motivated by only commercial
                        consideration”[6]. Given that this definition appears appropriate and reasonable, we will use it
                        in this paper. Hereafter, when we write market price, we are referring to the amount of money
                        utilized to facilitate a transaction between an independent seller and buyer.
                    </p>
                    <p> Now we can turn our attention to how the numeric value of market price is reached. Let’s
                        consider the following scenario—assume that there exist only two market participants with one
                        being an independent seller of a single stock for an ask price of 𝑎 , and the other being an
                        independent buyer of that stock with a bid price of 𝑏 . In this scenario, for a transaction to
                        take place between them, note that one of the following must be true: </p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-2">

                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box Box_theme mt-3 px-3 py-3 Sec_custom">
                        <p>Note: we have decided to leave out the case of ap ≥ bp, because if ap = bp, then this
                            scenario simplifies to the first case above. However, if ap > bp, then no transaction takes
                            place between the buyer and seller. </p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="mt-3">In the first case, the ask and bid price are strictly equal. Hence, the seller
                        receives the
                        amount he or she is willing to accept, while the buyer spends the amount he or she is willing to
                        pay. In this scenario, not only do we know that a transaction will take place, but we also know
                        the exact market price, which is ap or bp . Granted they are strictly equal, it does not matter
                        which. </p>
                    <p>In the second case, the ask price is less than or equal to the bid price. Hence, we know that a
                        transaction will take place; given that: the seller will at least receive the amount he or she
                        is willing to accept, while the buyer will at most spend the amount he or she is willing to pay.
                        However, despite knowing that a transaction will take place, note that we do not know the exact
                        market price. If the seller is kind, he or she will sell the stock for and receive ap. However,
                        if the seller recognizes that the buyer is willing to pay more, he or she will most likely
                        increase the price to: x such that ap < x ≤ bp. Hence, the market price appears to be a random
                            amount 𝑥 in the range of 𝑎ap ≤ x ≤ bp , and we will not know x (i.e., the market price)
                            until the transaction between the seller and buyer is finalized. </p>
                            <p>Expanding on our observations from this scenario, in the stock or cryptocurrency markets
                                where multiple orders flow through, we will not be able to predict before-hand
                                participants’ exact ask or bid prices. As a result of that, as well as a potential
                                negotiation that may take place as demonstrated above in case 2, the market price
                                appears to be a random variable—an unknown amount which is determined momentarily when a
                                seller and a buyer reach a transaction agreement. However, following their transaction,
                                it appears that the market price becomes an unknown amount again until another seller
                                and buyer reach a transaction agreement. </p>
                            <p>Given that the market price’s numeric value seems to be determined through the random ask
                                and bid process, we may never know before-hand, the exact price of a stock at some time
                                in the future. However, we certainly do know the individuals responsible for setting the
                                market price. If we assume that T ={ t0, t1 , t2 , …} is the set of all future times
                                beginning with the current time, t0 , and P ={ pt0,pt1 ,pt2 , …} is the set of all
                                market prices correlated to the times in the set T . Then, for any stock or
                                cryptocurrency, the market price (i.e., ptn), at time tn , is determined by market
                                participants; specifically, the subset of market participants submitting asks and bids
                                as illustrated in the following diagram. </p>

                                available to the public. Despite this limitation, we can certainly leverage market
                                participants’ current outlooks to make inferences about the market state and potential
                                future price movements. </p>
                            <p>Hence, our answer, to the question proposed in <span class="text-info fw-bold">section 2
                                    - 1,</span> is market participants. We
                                believe that surveying market participants over analysts provides more accurate
                                recommendations and price targets. Note that most analysts are not allowed to trade the
                                stocks or sectors which they cover; in these cases, they do not have a direct impact on
                                the market price. However, they do have an indirect impact on price through market
                                participants’ interpretation of their research and publications. This implies if we are
                                trying to identify the markets’ future expectations, we should go directly to the
                                participants’ that drive market price. </p>
                            <p>Now that we have identified our target survey population, which is market participants,
                                we can now return to and address the guiding problem statement of this white paper <span

                    <h2>3 - 1: Finulab – Quantitative Objective</h2>
                    <p>In addition to providing market participants the ability to critically discuss stocks and cryptos
                        <span class="fw-bold text-info">(section 3 - 4),</span> our objective, in the development of
                        Finulab, is to quantitatively capture
                        market participants’ future outlooks so that we can directly address the problem statement of
                        this white paper <span class="fw-bold text-info">(section 0 - 0).</span> Hence, Finulab contains
                        functionalities which empowers users
                        with the ability to provide their price target and recommendation (i.e., buy, hold, or sell) for
                        any stock or cryptocurrency. As mentioned in <span class="fw-bold text-info">section 2 -
                            2,</span> price targets and recommendations
                        are only valid until some new material information enters the public knowledge. Hence, to
                        accommodate for the changes is public information, users are also granted the privilege of being
                        able to update their price targets and recommendations at any time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Given that Finulab is an application centered around stocks and cryptocurrencies, we expect a
                        vast majority of its users to be market participants. Hence, through the functionality mentioned
                        in the previous paragraph, we will be able to approximate the market participants’ average price
                        target and recommendation distribution for any stock or cryptocurrency at a specific confidence
                        level and within a certain margin of error. We believe it is important to call out the
                        confidence level and margin of error associated with each stock or cryptocurrency’s survey
                        results, as these two figures underscore the reliability of our approximations. The results of
                        the price target and recommendations surveys, as well as the confidence level and margin of
                        error associated with each result, will be made available to the general public and all users of
                        Finulab. We believe it is important to make this information publicly available, as our
                        objective with Finulab is to provide market participants a data terminal that can be informative
                        and supportive in the performance of due diligence and market research. </p>

                    <p>Furthermore, given that the data Finulab collects through these surveys is a byproduct of users’
                        contributions, it is important to us to develop Finulab with transparency and ensure that its
                        market related data is publicly available. As mentioned previously in <span
                            class="text-info fw-bold">section 0 - 0,</span> we consider
                        users’ contributions on Finulab, including these survey responses, to be a form of service. As
                        such, all survey responses will be rewarded with Finux tokens; for further detail on Finulab’s
                        reward protocol, see <span class="text-info fw-bold">section 3 - 5.</span></p>

                    <p>Concerning to our statements in <span class="text-info fw-bold">section 2 - 1,</span> regarding
                        the count of polled analysts not
                        appearing to be statistically significant, we can now expound further to determine the minimum
                        sample size of users we need to survey on Finulab in order to reasonably approximate the
                        market’s average price target and recommendations distribution. The methodology we used to
                        determine the minimum sample size for average price targets and recommendations distribution is
                        documented in <span class="text-info fw-bold">section 3 - 2 and 3 - 3,</span>respectively.
                        Further, our full answer to the guiding
                        problem of this white paper is documented in <span class="text-info fw-bold">section 3 - 4.

                    <p class="mt-4">Our objective is to identify the average price target of market participants for any
                        given stock
                        or cryptocurrency. We can achieve that by surveying all market participants—unfortunately,
                        achieving that is not possible; furthermore, it is unnecessary. We can instead find and survey
                        the required minimum sample size of market participants to obtain a reasonable approximation of
                        the entire population’s (i.e., all market participants’) average price target. A minimum sample
                        size is the smallest number of observations that is required to obtain a statistically reliable
                        result—by statistically reliable, we mean a high confidence level (i.e., ≥ 90%) and small margin
                        of error (i.e., ≤ $0.03). In this segment, we will first discuss the approximate minimum sample
                        size required to find market participants’ average price target for the stocks selected as
                        examples in <span class="text-info fw-bold">FIG 4. </span> we will shift our focus on to the

                        margin of error, for any given stock or cryptocurrency. Our approach will rely on the following

                            than 30, the difference between a t-distribution and a normal distribution is negligible,

                    <p><span class="text-dark fw-bold">FIG. 6.</span> – We determined the approximate minimum sample
                        size at a confidence level of 90%, 95%,
                        and 99%; these confidence levels were matched with a desired margin of error of 3%, 2%, and 1%,
                        respectively. Detailed above is the summary of the calculation performed at Finux.A, tabs 0-1 to
                        1-5. </p>
                    <p>Our main objective in including the tables above is to highlight that even at a desired
                        confidence level of 90% and margin of error of $0.03, we need to poll a significant amount of
                        market participants to approximate the market’s price target for any given stock. Notice that in
                        <span class="text-info fw-bold">FIG 3,</span> AMZN had the largest count of polled analysts at a
                        count of 53— at a confidence level of
                        90% and a margin of error of $0.03, we would need 118,982 polled market participants to find the
                        approximation of the market’s average price target for AMZN. Hence, if our objective is to
                        approximate the market’s future outlooks on the price target of any stock as accurately as
                        possible, analysts price targets are not too reliable. This is because, if we assume a
                        confidence level of 90%, the margin of error with a sample count of 53 is $2.34. This is not too
                        reliable, especially when you consider the frequency with which their targets are updated, as
                        well as the fact that most analysts cannot trade the stocks which they cover (implying that
                        cannot partake in the pricing process of the market).
                    </p>

                    <p>Hence, to improve this system, on Finulab we will instead be polling users, which should serve as
                        a good proxy for market participants. Furthermore, given that it’s a free and open platform, we
                        believe the high minimum sample counts, demonstrated above in <span
                            class="text-info fw-bold">FIG
                            3,</span> is achievable. As a result,
                        we will be able to approximate the market’s average price target for any given stock or
                        cryptocurrency with a high confidence level and small margin of error. On Finulab, rather than
                        just stating the average price target, we underscore the average market price alongside the
                        confidence level and margin of error. Furthermore, we will display the confidence interval to
                        allow users to better visual the potential distribution of the market’s average price
                        distribution. The methodology we will use to do so will rely on the number of samples, as
                        highlighted below. </p>
                    <ol class="list_Font">
                        <li>If we obtain 30 samples or less, we will utilize a t-distribution to construct the
                            confidence interval, through the following formula: 𝑥±𝑡 / ∙ √ .. </li>
                        <li>However, if we obtain over 30 samples, we will instead use a normal distribution to
                            construct the confidence interval, through the following formula: : 𝑥±𝑧 / ∙ √ . </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Through this approach, we believe that we can not only more accurately approximate the market’s
                        price targets, but we can also ensure users have a clearer understanding of the reliability of
                        our results on Finulab. </p>

                    <p>Our objective here is to identify the percentage of market participants that recommend buy, hold,
                        or sell for any given stock or cryptocurrency. Similar to the average price target, we can
                        achieve this through surveying all market participants; however, that is not feasible or
                        necessary. We can instead sample a portion of market participants to approximate the
                        recommendations distribution for any given stock or cryptocurrency. Similar to the average price
                        target, our goal is to maximize the confidence level and minimize the margin of error as well.
                        As such, we will follow the same format. We will first discuss the approximate minimum sample
                        size required to find the distribution of market participants’ recommendations for any given
                        stock or cryptocurrency. Thereafter, we will shift our focus on to the general methodology that
                        will be used on Finulab to identify the recommendation distribution, as well as the confidence
                        level and margin of error. Our approach will rely on the following notations:

                        market participants’ recommendation distribution such that the probability will be at

                        that all of the estimated proportions (i.e., percentage of market participants that
                        recommend
                        buy, hold, or sell) will simultaneously be within 3% of the true proportion, we will
                        need
                        1,119
                        survey responses. Referring back to <span class="fw-bold text-info">FIG 4,</span> AMZN
                        had
                        the
                        largest count of polled analysts at
                        53—if our objective is to find the true distribution of recommendations, at a confidence
                        level
                        of 90%, we can approximately expect the margin of error from a sample size of 53 to be
                        13%.
                        As a
                        byproduct, if our goal is to utilize the distribution of analysts’ recommendations to
                        make
                        market inferences, a sample size of 53 is not too reliable. </p>

                    <p>Hence, to improve the system, on Finulab we will poll users for their recommendations.
                        Thereafter, we will display the distribution of recommendations, as well as the
                        confidence
                        level
                        and margin of error associated with the survey, for all stocks and cryptocurrencies. To
                        determine the margin of error, note that we will use the formula stated above. Through
                        this
                        approach, we believe can more accurately approximate the recommendations distribution of
                        market
                        participants to better inform Finulab users. Furthermore, users can assess the
                        reliability
                        of
                        the polls results through our confidence level and margin of error figures for any stock
                        or
                        cryptocurrency. </p>

                    <p>The quantitative analysis of market participants’ average price targets and
                        recommendation
                        distributions, alongside the vast amount market data available on Finulab, can only
                        provide
                        a
                        limited perspective of the market. Even if we may understand and visualize the numerical
                        values,
                        the underlying factors driving these figures, the “why”, may not be immediately
                        apparent.
                        Hence,
                        to complement the quantitative aspects of the platform, Finulab also has social media
                        features
                        built-in, which allows market participants to engage in free and open critical
                        discussions.
                        Through the social media aspect of the platform, the quantitative segment of due
                        diligence
                        and
                        market research can be adequately complemented by the qualitive analysis in order to
                        provide
                        users a more comprehensive perspective on the layout of the market.
                    </p>
                    <p>Especially in a volatile market, it is necessary to crowd-source market participants’
                        insights,
                        in real-time, to truly capture the state of the market and make a more well-informed
                        decision.
                        Furthermore, users’ discussions and realtime insights can clarify the average price
                        targets
                        and
                        recommendation distribution data that will be available for any given stock or
                        cryptocurrency on
                        Finulab. As such, we consider users qualitative contributions just as useful as their
                        quantitative contribution. Hence, users of the Finulab platform will also receive
                        rewards in

                    <p class="mt-5"><span class="fw-bold text-dark">FIG. 8.</span> – Displayed above is the
                        initial
                        baseline for
                        engagement rewards on Finulab. Note that
                        the Sign-Up and Invite rewards will remain consistent and will exist only for limited
                        amount
                        of
                        time. However, every other reward type will decrease overtime as the max supply of Finux
                        is
                        capped. </p>
                    <p>The Sign-Up and Invite rewards are only available for a limited amount of time to support
                        Finulab
                        reach a critical mass of users. Following that, those two reward types will be
                        suspended.
                        These
                        two actions’ reward amounts of 5 and 10, respectively, will not be decreasing over time;
                        they
                        will consistently remain to be 5 and 10 until suspended. </p>
                    <p>However, all the other rewards will continue to exist, ever after a critical mass of
                        users
                        has
                        been reached. For these reward types, the amounts, as show above, are a baseline. These
                        reward
                        amounts will continually decrease based on the engagement gained on Finulab, as well as
                        the
                        remain available supply of the Finux token that has not yet been distributed to the
                        users.
                        On a
                        minute-by-minute bases, these reward amounts will be divided by the total supply of
                        Finux
                        tokens
                        (i.e., 150M) and then multiplied by the remaining uncirculated supply of Finux tokens
                        (i.e.,
                        150M subtracted by users’ earned rewards). For example, if the uncirculated supply of
                        Finux
                        tokens is 109.09M, then the Price Target reward amount is: ~0.0727 (i.e., (0.1 ÷ 150M) x
                        109.09M). Though this method of reward calculations, we ensure that the capped supply of
                        Finux
                        is not exceeded. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, note that if the activity generated on Finulab grows fairly rapidly, it
                        might
                        not
                        suffice to update the reward amounts on a minute-by-minute bases. If the rapid growth is
                        consistent, it might result in all Finux tokens being distributed, which will leave
                        future
                        users
                        unable to earn any. Therefore, it Finulab grows more rapidly than expected, instead of
                        adjusting
                        the reward amount on a minute-by-minute bases, we will adjust them at the engagement
                        level
                        (since engagements are what generates the rewards). At the moment, there isn’t a place
                        where
                        users will be able to find the current reward amounts. However, by June 30, 2024, we
                        will
                        also
                        update the main Finux website (finux.xyz) to complement Finulab. At that point, the
                        current
                        reward amounts table, the estimated distribution forecast of the Finux token, as well as
                        other
                        supply data, will be on that site and available to all. </p>

                    <h2>4 - 1 – Conclusion </h2>
                    <p>Our objective in the creation of Finulab is to ensure that the general public is informed
                        as
                        accurately as possible on the current state of the market in both sentiment and hard
                        financial
                        data. Sentiment is unfortunately often disregarded; John Maynard Keynes is often quotes
                        as
                        saying: “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” The supposed
                        irrationality of the markets is a byproduct of the market participants’ sentiments. The
                        better
                        we can understand it, the better our investment decision become. Furter, the only way we
                        can
                        understand it is by giving market participants’ a platform full dedicated to them.
